android studio calculator, to solve the basic operations like add, subtract, multiply, divide along with solving the brackets and power functions inthe project.


This is java based code. 
It cantains some of the glitches in which i need your help, It can accept the brackets and other inputs like power and decimals multiple times, but I added the toast in it which shows that the input is invalid. its working fine error handling is little bit needed.
